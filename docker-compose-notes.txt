Create one folder name docker-compose 

    under that folder create 2 folders
        backend:
            backend code files
            dockerfile
        frontend:
            frontend code files
            dockerfile

        docker-compose.yml

this yml configuration configure the service for frontend, backend,
database and networks

you just need to run 1 command: sudo docke-compose up --build -d 
 (it build images,create network, start containers)

sudo docker-compose down
    (stop containers, rm containers, remove network)

if docker-compose is not installed :
  sudo apt install docker-compose -y

to access the database:
   sudo docker exec -it mysql_conatiner mysql -u root -p 
   enter password configured in yml:admin
   run command: show databases;
   u can see the flaskapp db must be there.

To access backend: localhost:5000/api 
Frontend: localhost (only as its running on 80)
